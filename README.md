- CSS Grid
- Solution of issues
- Responsive CSS

### What I learned

1. **Basic HTML Structure:** I learned how to structure the content using HTML elements like `header`, `section`, `div`, `h1`, `img`, `p`, `a`, `ul`, and `li`.

2. **Basic CSS Styling:** Learned how to apply CSS styles to control the appearance of content, defining colors, fonts, sizes, margins, paddings, borders, and other visual aspects.

3. **Responsiveness:** How to adapt the layout for different screen sizes, using media queries to adjust specific styles for mobile devices like iPhone X and iPhone 8.

4. **Button Styling:** I learned how to create styled buttons with CSS, defining background colors, text colors, borders, border-radius, hover effects, and other details to enhance interactivity.

5. **Importance of Specificity:** And I understood the importance of properly specifying my CSS selectors to ensure that rules are applied to the desired elements, avoiding conflicts with other style rules.


### Continued development

This project has been a valuable learning experience, solidifying my understanding of core web development concepts. Here are some areas where I'd like to focus in future projects:

- CSS mastery: Advanced layouts (flexbox, grid) for future projects.
- JavaScript integration: Building interactive and dynamic web experiences.
- Animation exploration: Enhancing user experience with subtle animations.
- Accessibility focus: Building inclusive websites for everyone.
